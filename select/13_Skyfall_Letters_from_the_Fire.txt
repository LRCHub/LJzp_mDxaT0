Locked in the prison in my mind
I'm burning hopelessly from the anger inside
Your decisions make your worlds collide
Broken, rotten beast on the inside

Stuck in the shackles of your lies
I'm never knowing when, never knowing why
You can take my soul dead or alive
And just set me free, because you know I

I will not back down
I will now rise and stand up
This is my life now
No one will notice you fuck

Fuck me over
With your convictions locked up
I will destroy you
Before I ever give up

I will not back down
I will now rise and stand up
This is my life now
No one will notice you fuck

Fuck me over
With your convictions locked up
I will destroy you
Before I ever give

I will not back down
I will now rise and stand up
This is my life now
No one will notice you fuck

Fuck me over
With your convictions locked up
I will destroy you
Before I ever give up
